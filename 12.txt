Which algorithm is most efficient for large datasets?|Merge Sort
What is the time complexity of Merge Sort?|O(n log n)

Which of the following code snippets correctly performs a binary search for the number 25 in the sorted array int[] array = {5, 15, 25, 35, 45};?|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 int low = 0; int high = array.length - 1; while (low <= high) { int mid = (low + high) / 2; if (array[mid] == 25) return mid; else if (array[mid] < 25) low = mid + 1; else high = mid - 1; }
What is the most efficient way to remove a node from the end of a singly linked list?|Traverse to the node before the tail, set its nextto null, and update the tail.
What is the most efficient way to add a node at the end of a doubly linked list?|Update the next reference of the current tail and the prev reference of the new node.
Which method would you use to remove all entries from a HashMap<String, Integer> map?|map.clear();
Which sorting algorithm is not suitable for very large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity?|Insertion Sort
How does Merge Sort operate?|It divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them.
In a sorted array of 1000 elements, how many comparisons would binary search take in the worst case?|10
What is the time complexity for searching an element in a TreeMap?|O(log n)
You are retrieving the grade of a student named "Alice" from a LinkedHashMap<String, Integer> map. Which method call would you use to get the student's grade, assuming you want to handle cases where the student may not exist in the map?|map.get("Alice");
True or false: In a doubly linked list, the addBefore(Node targetNode, Node newNode) method adds the new node after the target node.|False
