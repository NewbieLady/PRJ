Suppose you have a list of students with their study hours and attendance. You are using this list to create a decision tree that predicts whether a student will Pass or Fail based on how many hours they have studied and their attendance. Now, if you use the following dataset to train a decision tree to classify "Pass" or "Fail" based on study hours and attendance: Study Hours Attendance Result greater than 8 greater than 90% Pass greater than 4 greater than 70% Pass All other paths should result in a Fail. The decision tree predicts the result for a new student who studied for 6 hours and attended 80% of the classes. What is the most likely output if study hours is evaluated first followed by attendance?|Pass
