You are working on a new project in IntelliJ and want to set up Git for version control. After creating the project, what is the first step to start using Git for the project?|Initialize the repository with git init.
You are developing a new feature using test-driven development in Java. How does JUnit help in the TDD process. Select all that apply.|It helps identify whether new code passes or fails.$It facilitates refactoring by ensuring that the existing tests still pass.$It allows you to write tests before implementing the feature.
You have implemented a method -add(int a, int b) - in a class named Calculator, using TDD and it works perfectly. Now, the requirements have changed, and you are required to first multiply each number passed by 2 before adding them. Which stage of the Red-Green-Refactor cycle are you in?|Red - write a new failing test for the updated functionality in a new method.
You have several test classes for your application, namely AddTest, SubtractTest, and MultipleTest. What is the primary benefit of running them as part of a test suite?|It allows you to test multiple functionalities and test classes in one execution.
Which type of testing is done with knowledge of the internal structure of the code?|White-box testing
Which of the following best describes a test case?|A set of instructions to validate a specific feature.
You are testing a login feature for an application. The feature allows users to log in with valid credentials and displays an error if the username and password are incorrect. What would be the first step when writing a test case for this feature?|Identify the scenarios for valid and invalid login.
What is the primary purpose of version control in the software development process? Select all that apply|To manage changes to code over time.$To allow multiple developers to collaborate on the same project.
You are working on a Git project. You make changes to a file which was previously committed. So, what are the stages that you would go through to save the changes?|Modified - staged - committed
You are following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to implement a method in Java that calculates the sum of three numbers. What is the first step in this process?|Write a failing test using JUnit for the method.
You have three separate test classes for your Calculatorclass. The test classes are AddTest, SubtractTest and MultiplyTest. How can you run all of these test classes at once?|By creating a JUnit test suite and including the test classes we want to run together.
Which of the following components are included in a test case? Select all that apply.|Pre-conditions$Expected results$A set of instructions
True or False: Jenkins is used as a continuous integration tool, not for writing Java tests.|True
What role does JUnit play in Test Driven Development (TDD) when testing Java code?|JUnit helps in writing unit tests before writing the actual code.
