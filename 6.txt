Select the correct option to complete the following: While implementing error handling, a properly written try statement would have ________ catch block(s) and ________ finally block(s).|zero or more, zero or one

Which of the following is considered a best practice for handling exceptions in a Java program?|Using specific catch blocks with different exception types.
You're writing a program to demonstrate how an exception causes a program to terminate unexpectedly. The program below throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException first, and it matches both the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and the Exception catch blocks. Which of the following catch blocks would be executed first? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 public class ExceptionHandlingExample { public static void main(String[] args) { try { int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3}; int result = numbers[3] / 0; // This will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException first } catch (ArithmeticException arithmeticException) { System.out.println("ArithmeticException caught"); } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException arrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) { System.out.println("ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException caught"); } catch (Exception exception) { System.out.println("General Exception caught"); } } }|The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException catch block.
