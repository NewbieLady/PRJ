Consider the following Java code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 interface Printable { void print(String name); } class Greetings implements Printable { void print(String name, String message) { System.out.println("Hello "+name+" "+message); } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args){ Greetings obj = new Greetings(); obj.print("Shane", "Good morning"); } }|This is because the signatures of the print() method in the interface and the class don't match.
